The header files that are included when compiling the code of native packages in the FastR environment.

The starting position is that these files are identical to those in GnuR and that the FastR implementation
differences are entirely encapsulated in the method implementations in the fficall library. It is TBD whether
this can be completely transparent but,if not, the goalk would be for minimal changes to the standard header files.
