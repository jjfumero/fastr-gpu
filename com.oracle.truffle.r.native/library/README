This directory tree contains the default packages for FastR. Each package directory contains a '.gz' file that was
created from the corresponding GnuR 'library' directory, plus necessary C source and header files, most notably 'init.c',
also copied from GnuR. Since these files reference functions in the GnuR implementation, 'init.c' is recompiled
in the FastR environment and the resulting '.so' replaces the one from the '.gz' file in the FastR 'library' directory.
Absolutely minimal changes are made to the C source, typically just to define (as empty functions), rather than reference,
the C functions that are passed to R_registerRoutines. This step is still necesssary in FastR as it causes R symbols that are'
referenced in the R package code to become defined.

Note that 'datasets' and 'fastr' don't actually have any native code, but it is convenient to store them here. Note also that
'fastr', obviously, does not originate from GnuR, so its build process is completely different.

Given that we only support MacOS/Linux, it is expedient to just store the tar'ed content of the GnuR library directories
for those targets as 'source' files in the distribution. In time, when FastR can create packages directly, the build will
change to work that way.
