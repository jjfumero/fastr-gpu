# This "builds" the "fastr" package, which defines functions that can
# access the internals of the FastR implementation, e.g., print Truffle ASTs.
# It is a "real" package, and loaded in the same way as any R package.

# We use a 'tar' file of the sources as the sentinel for whether the INSTALL step is needed
# Since this is just R code, we use GnuR to do the INSTALL. In case the system does not have R 
# installed we use the one we built.
