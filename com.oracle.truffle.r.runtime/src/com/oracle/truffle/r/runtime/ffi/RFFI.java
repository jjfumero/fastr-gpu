 * <li>{@link StatsRFFI}: native functions in the {@code stats} package.</li>

 * <li>{@link CallRFFI}: {@code .Call} and {@code .External} call interface.</li>
 * <li>{@link UserRngRFFI}: specific interface to user-supplied random number generator.</li>
 * <li>{@link PCRERFFI}: interface to PCRE library (Perl regexp).</li>
